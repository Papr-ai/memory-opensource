If repairs are needed, apply only to a technical assistance centre approved by the manufacturer and insist on the use of original spare parts. Failure to comply with the above may endanger the safety of the machine.\n  \n  INTRODUCTION\n  \n  Keep this manual with care for future consultation; the use and maintenance manual is an integral part on the dryer. Read this manual carefully before carrying out any operations on the dryer. The installation of the dryer and all operations involving it must be performed in conformity with the regulations in force concerning electric plants and personal safety.\n  \n  CHARACTERISTICS AND SAFETY PRECAUTIONS\n  \n  BEFORE REMOVING THE PROTECTIVE GUARDS TO CARRY OUT ANY MAINTENANCE ON THE MACHINE, SWITCH OFF THE ELECTRIC POWER SUPPLY AND DISCHARGE THE RESIDUAL PRESSURE INSIDE THE UNIT. ALL WORK ON THE ELECTRIC PLANT, HOWEVER SLIGHT, MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY PROFESSIONALLY SKILLED PERSONNEL.\n  \n  The manufacturer does not accept responsibility for damage caused as a result of negligence of failure to abide by the instructions given above.\n  \n  THIS MACHINE IS NOT SUITABLE FOR EXTERNAL INSTALLATION\n  \n  THIS MACHINE CORRESPOND TO THE ESSENTIAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FORESEEN FROM THE EUROPEAN STANDARD (2006/42 CE).\n  \n  THE LUBRICATING LIQUIDS AND OTHER EVENTUAL FLUIDS MUST NOT BE DISCHARGED IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE POLLUTING AND HAZARDOUS PRODUCTS MUST COMPULSORY BE DISPOSED BY CHARGING AUTHORISED AND SPECIALISED FIRMS ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT TYPOLOGY OF PRODUCT.\n  \n  DIFFERENTIATE THE COMPRESSOR COMPONENTS ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS (PLASTIC, COPPER, IRON, OIL FILTER, AIR FILTER ECC...)\n  \n  2-Edition 09/2020 Cod. 2200780127 04 -\n  \n  ENGLISH\n  \n  1.0 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS\n  \n  The dryer is a chilling machine with direct expansion and dry evaporator. The air to be dried is sent to the heat exchanger in which the water vapour present is condensed: the condensate gathers in the separator and is discharged outside through a steam trap.\n  \n  2.0 INTENDED USE\n  \n  The dryer has been built to dry the compressed air for industrial use. The dryer cannot be used in premises where there is a risk of fire or explosion or where work is carried out which releases substances into the environment which are dangerous with regard to safety (for example: solvents, inflammable vapours, alcohol, etc.). In particular the appliance cannot be used to produce air to be breathed by humans or used on direct contact with foodstuffs. These uses are allowed if the compressed air produced is filtered by means of a suitable filtering system (Consult the manufacturer for these special uses.)\n  \n  This appliance must be used only for the purpose for which it was specifically designed. All other uses are to be considered incorrect and therefore unreasonable. The Manufacturer cannot be held responsible for any damage resulting from improper, incorrect or unreasonable use.\n  \n  3.0 OPERATION\n  \n  The gaseous refrigerant coming from the evaporator (4) is sucked by the refrigeration compressor (1) and it is pumped into the condenser (2). This one allows its condensation, eventually with the help of the fan (3); the condensed refrigerant passes through the dewatering filter (8) and it expands through the capillary tube (7) and goes back to the evaporator where it produces the refrigerating effect. Due to the heat exchange with the compressed air which passes through the evaporator against the stream, the refrigerant evaporates and goes back to the compressor for a new cycle. The circuit is equipped with a bypass system for the refrigerant; this intervenes to adjust the available refrigerating capacity to the actual cooling load. This is achieved by injecting hot gas under the control of the valve (9): this valve keeps constant the pressure of the refrigerant in the evaporator and therefore also the dew point never decreases below (0 °C / 32°) Fin order to prevent the condensate from freezing inside the evaporator. The dryer runs completely automatically.\n  \n  DRYER FLOW DIAGRAM\n  \n  4.0 GENERAL SAFETY STANDARD\n  \n  The appliance may be used only by specially trained and authorized personnel. Any tampering with the machine or alterations not approved beforehand by the Manufacturer relieve the latter of responsibility for any damage resulting from the above actions. The removal of or tampering with the safety devices constitutes a violation of the European Standards on safety.\n  \n  ALL WORK ON THE ELECTRIC PLANT, HOWEVER SLIGHT, MUST BE CARRIED OUT BY PROFESSIONALLY SKILLED PERSONNEL.\n  \n  Cod. 2200780127 04 Edition 09/2020 - 3\n  \n  ENGLISH\n  \n  5.0 DESCRIPTION OF DANGER SIGNALS\n  \n  6.0 DANGER ZONES\n  6.1 DANGER ZONES\n  \n  7.0 SAFETY DEVICES\n  7.1 SAFETY DEVICES\n  \n  1) Cooling fan shield\n  \n  2) Earth\n  \n  4-Edition 09/2020 Cod. 2200780127 04 -\n  \n  ENGLISH\n  \n  8.0 POSITION OF PLATES 8.1 POSITION OF THE DANGER PLATES (Fig. 4)\n  \n  The plates fitted on the compressor unit are part of the machine; they have been applied for safety purposes and must not be removed or spoiled for any reason.
