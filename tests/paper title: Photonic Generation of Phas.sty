 paper title: Photonic Generation of Phase-Coded Microwave Signal With Large Frequency Tunability. abstract: A photonic approach to realizing phase-coded microwave signal generation with large frequency tunability is proposed and demonstrated. Two coherent optical wavelengths are generated based on external modulation by biasing a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) at the minimum transmission point to generate \u00b11 -order sidebands while suppressing the optical carrier. The two \u00b11-order sidebands are then sent to a fiber Sagnac interferometer (SI) incorporating an optical phase modulator (PM) and a broadband flat-top fiber Bragg grating (FBG), with one of the sidebands being phase modulated at the PM. A frequency tunable phase-coded microwave signal is generated by beating the two sidebands at a photodetector (PD). The proposed technique is experimentally investigated. The generation of a frequency tunable phase-coded microwave signal at 22 and 27 GHz is demonstrated. publication date: 2011-06-01. venue: IEEE Photonics Technology Letters. relations: . paper cites paper: (\"Vector Signal Generation Using a Polarization and a Phase Modulator in a Sagnac Loop\", \"A simple photonic generation of linearly chirped microwave pulse with large time-bandwidth product and high compression ratio.\", \"Photonic generation of microwave frequency shift keying signal using a single-drive Mach\u2013Zehnder modulator\", \"Generation of phase-coded microwave signals using a polarization-modulator-based photonic microwave phase shifter.\", \"Photonic generation of a phase-coded microwave signal based on a single dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator.\", \"Photonic generation of binary and quaternary phase-coded microwave waveforms with an ultra-wide frequency tunable range.\", \"Photonic Generation of Chirp-Free Phase-Coded Microwave With Accurate $\\pi$ Phase Shift and Large Continuous Operating Bandwidth\", \"All-optical generation of binary phase-coded microwave signal based on cross-polarization modulation in a highly nonlinear fiber\", \"Photonic generation and independent steering of multiple RF signals for software defined radars\", \"Photonic Generation of Phase Coded Microwave Pulses Using Cascaded Polarization Modulators\", \"Linear photonic technique for fixed and time varying RF phase shifts of radar signals\", \"Photonic generation of phase-coded microwave signals with tunable carrier frequency\", \"Photonic Generation of a Phase-Coded Microwave Waveform With Ultrawide Frequency Tunable Range\", \"Single Phase Modulator for Binary Phase-Coded Microwave Signals Generation\", \"Photonic generation of widely tunable and background-free binary phase-coded radio-frequency pulses\", \"Phase Coding of RF Pulses in Photonics-Aided Frequency-Agile Coherent Radar Systems\", \"Photonic generation of widely tunable phase-coded microwave signals based on a dual-parallel polarization modulator\", \"Photonic Generation of Precisely $\\pi$ Phase-Coded Microwave Signal With Broadband Tunability\", \"Photonic generation of arbitrarily phase-modulated microwave signals based on a single DDMZM\", \"Photonic Generation of Frequency-Quadrupled Microwave Signal With Tunable Phase Shift\", \"Simultaneous generation of a frequency-multiplied and phase-shifted microwave signal with large tunability\", \"Photonic Generation of Phase-Modulated RF Signals for Pulse Compression Techniques in Coherent Radars\", \"Photonic Generation of Binary Phase-Coded Microwave Signals With Large Frequency Tunability Using a Dual-Parallel Mach\u2013Zehnder Modulator\", \"Photonic Generation of Precisely $\\pi$ Phase-Shifted Binary Phase-Coded Microwave Signal\", \"Multi-frequency phase-coded microwave signal generation based on polarization modulation and balanced detection.\", \"Photonic Generation of Binary and Quaternary Phase-Coded Microwave Waveforms With Frequency Quadrupling\", \"Generation of a Frequency-Quadrupled Phase-Coded Signal With Large Tunability\", \"Phase-coded microwave signal generation based on a single electro-optical modulator and its application in accurate distance measurement.\", \"Photonic Microwave Signal Mixing Using Sagnac-Loop-Based Modulator and Polarization-Dependent Modulation\", \"Generation of a frequency-quadrupled phase-coded signal using optical carrier phase shifting and balanced detection.\", \"Photonic generation of multi-frequency phase-coded microwave signal based on a dual-output Mach-Zehnder modulator and balanced detection.\", \"Silicon microring modulator-based RF mixer for millimeter-wave phase-coded signal generation.\", \"Photonic generation of RF binary digitally modulated signals.\", \"A Frequency-Tunable Binary Phase-Coded Microwave Signal Generator With a Tunable Frequency Multiplication Factor\", \"High-Speed and Wideband Frequency-Hopping Microwave Signal Generation via Switching the Bias Point of an Optical Modulator\", \"Photonic generation of binary and quaternary phase-coded microwave signals by utilizing a dual-polarization dual-parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator\", \"Frequency-modulated continuous-wave generation based on an optically injected semiconductor laser with optical feedback stabilization.\"),. paper has_topic field_of_study: (Photonics, Electronic engineering, Fiber Bragg grating, Microwave, Optoelectronics, Modulation, Electro-optic modulator, Phase modulation, Optics, Physics, Optical Carrier transmission rates, Amplitude modulation),. author writes paper: (Xianmin Zhang (Zhejiang University), Hao Chi (Zhejiang University), Wangzhe Li (Chinese Academy of Sciences, University of Ottawa, University of California, Santa Barbara), Jianping Yao (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Dalian University of Technology, Xidian University, University of Ottawa, Nanjing University), Ze Li (Zhejiang University, University of Ottawa)),
